# blog_vite
frontend for my little blog. backend here : https://github.com/sqrtM/blog_back

start of what will eventually be my portfolio and personal blog. slapped together with vite and that cool new speedy compiler thing they got going on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lots of cool features i have in mind.
1. easy navigation between blog and home and projects etc ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79169638/210120886-7d6073ef-45bb-421b-8edc-317ad337b0d3.png)
2. in browser editing (gonna make this more robust later, with a better editor, but it works for now) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79169638/210120909-8e098362-486d-42ee-a017-c6626bb89e18.png)
3. nice, basic, but aesthetic blog interface which looks nice on any device ...............

3. complete, arbitrary, highly dangerous, highly cool css and script allowance to allow for deeply displeasing and creative posts ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79169638/210120929-9315d783-7400-4cfa-bad7-0b86df4ea370.png)
(obviously inspired a bit by Cohost, but i wanted something that could go a little further)
